# Time in Bank
This is a small Cookie Clicker mod for the Steam version of the game. It enhances the Genius accounting heavenly upgrade by providing an indicator of the effective amount of time in your bank (e.g. 3 hours or 15 days).

## Installation
Until Steam Workshop support is added, the mod has to be installed manually by copying the repository root directory into:

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cookie Clicker\resources\app\mods\local

If you have a custom Steam library folder, replace up to `Steam` with its path. The mod should be enabled as soon as you (re)start the game.
